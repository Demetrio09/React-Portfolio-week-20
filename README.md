# React Portfolio

Now that I've worked with React and have multiple projects to share, I updated my portfolio and other materials to build toward being employer competitive. Created a portfolio using React will help set me apart from other developers whose portfolios do not use some of the latest technologies.

## React

- A `Header` component that appears on multiple pages

- `Components` that have been used multiple times on a single page

- `Navigation` with React Router, dynamic rendering.

- A `Footer` component that appears on multiple pages

#### Design

As with the previous portfolio homework, "good" design is subjective. Your site should look
"polished." Here are a few guidelines on what that means:

- Mobile-first design

- Choosed a color palette for your site so it doesn't just look like
  the default bootstrap theme or an unstyled HTML site.

- Making sure the font size is large enough to read, and that the colors don't cause eye strain.
